# Wrangle Demo

Wrangle is an experimental jQuery plugin created by ZURB, a product design company agency in Campbell, California. The plugin allows the user to multiple-select items by drawing a line through them. This is a sample application showing how Wrangle can be used with Foundation to create a basic responsive web app.

## Setup

After cloning/downloading the repository to your local machine, you'll need to compile the Sass files once to get going:

  cd wrangle-demo
  compass watch .

Make sure you have the `compass` and `zurb-foundation` gems installed on your machine.

## More Info

You can find the full documentation for Wrangle on its GitHub repository. Also be sure to check out Wrangle's page on ZURBplayground.
