# Wrangle Demo

Wrangle is an experimental jQuery plugin created by ZURB, a product design company agency in Campbell, California. The plugin allows the user to multiple-select items by drawing a line through them. This is a sample application showing how Wrangle can be used with Foundation to create a basic responsive web app.

## Setup

To start, clone or download the file to your local machine.

    $ git clone https://github.com/zurb/wrangle-demo.git
    
This demo requires Foundation and Compass. Make sure you've got the gems for both installed:

    $ gem install compass
    $ gem install zurb-foundation

You'll need to compile the Sass files once to get going.

    $ cd wrangle-demo
    $ compass watch .
